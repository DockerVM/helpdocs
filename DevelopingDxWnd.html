<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">Now the second question: why someone should ever bother to develop a thing like this? This is different story. I started looking for a window-izer for a specific purpose: not having a dual monitor PC at home, I was looking for a way to debug fullscreen videogames. Looking in the net resources, I got references to an asian (japanese?) DxWnd project that seemed discontinued, but left an old copy of the C++ sources (unfortunately, not the most recent release) to be downloaded. After that, there were several attempts to translate and improve the program, but none shared the sources again. When I opened the project trying to understand the basic principle, I found that it was incredibly simple and yet sophisticated, acting I think in a very close way as virus or anti-virus programs do.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">So I just thought it was such a pity that this incredible piece of artwork of C++ programming could be left discontinued, and then I decided to “adopt” the project and continue it, even if in the meanwhile I bought a second monitor for my domestic PC. And for the same reason, I published the source code on sourceforge, a proper location for any open source piece of coding, and I encourage anyone to join the project and extend it further on. And let me thank again the mysterious coder whose only trail left to make a reference is SFB7: whoever you are, SFB7 (if this was your nick), thank you. </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">From the time I published the first DxWnd releases, then, a lot of improvements have been made, &nbsp;most of them involving sophisticated techniques that I learnt from several great teachers, coming from SourceForge, CodeProject and anywhere else in the net. Thank you all, open source supporters!</span></p>
