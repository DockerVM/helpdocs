<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">Let's start with the first one. Once upon a time (in the IT clock, that means a few years ago) people used to have clumsy PCs that in a slow and single-threaded environment tried to do their best to impress their owner with strength demonstrations, usually trying to move colored pixels on the screen in the fastest possible way. That custom was named videogaming, and implied using all tricky ways to improve the system performances. One common way to do that, was to highjack all hardware resources and dedicate them for this single purpose, of course disabling any attempt to run parallel tasks in other portions of the screen: the classic example being any videogame developed for Win95 and further.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">Now, you guys may ask yourselves why should all this time be passed away and PC increased their power by a 100x times more, to keep playing the very same game in the very same environment. Someone is calling you on a chat? A new email message is arrived? You want to browse the net meanwhile? Something is happening on your favourite social network or MMPORPG? Forget about it! You're currently dealing with a task that wants 100% of your attention, even if it uses 1% of your PC power. So, why not attempting to push this old and invasive application within a window of its own ? </span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">That's what DxWnd is mainly for: let fullscreen applications run pretending they're still in a fullscreen context, but actually within their own separate window. And, taking advantage of the code hooking needed to do so, in some case it may even happen that things are further improved, but we'll see this later.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8">A second undoubtful fact is the technological evolution that has turned games from different windows operating systems (through Windows 95 to current Windows 8), CPU architectures (16, 32, 64 bits) and from old and tricky directdraw support to recent 3D libraries like direct3d 8/9/10/11, and OpenGL. This evolution has left some victims behind: a lot of wonderful games are no longer supported in the current environment, even despite the efforts Microsoft is making to support legacy. In some cases, DxWnd is crucial to recover these old glories of the past.</span></p>
